            Looking up at the stars, I know quite well <br>
            That, for all they care, I can go to hell, <br>
            But on earth indifference is the least <br>
            We have to dread from man or beast. <br>
            <br>
            How should we like it were stars to burn <br>
            With a passion for us we could not return? <br>
            If equal affection cannot be, <br>
            Let the more loving one be me. <br>
            <br>
            Admirer as I think I am <br>
            Of stars that do not give a damn, <br>
            I cannot, now I see them, say <br>
            I missed one terribly all day. <br>
            <br>
            Were all stars to disappear or die, <br>
            I should learn to look at an empty sky <br>
            And feel its total dark sublime, <br>
            Though this might take me a little time. <br>
